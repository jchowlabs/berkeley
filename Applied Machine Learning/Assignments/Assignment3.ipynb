        "**ANSWER:** (See below ): \n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3.5:** The KNN algorithm calculates distance between prediction data and all the training data, in order to classify the prediction data to a given label (i.e. documents with similar words will have similar labels). However, the KNN algorithm suffers from sparse datasets, such as the train_data dataset. From Q2, we see a raw vocabularly size of 27,869 unique words and an average of 97 unique words per document. In other words, the dataset is very sparse, given a vast number of words in the vocabulary, and only a small fraction of those words in each document. The documents also contain numerous common/stop words that are shared across each label, further confusing the knn algorithm and explaining the poor performance across the 8 k values used. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3.6:** In general, the Naive Bayes algorithm performs better with less data while Logistic Regression algorithm performs better with linear data. The relatively small dataset (ony 2034 documents) coupled with the sparsity of the dataset (26,876 vocabulary size) likely explains why then Naive Bayes algorithm performed better than Logistic Regression. However, given a larger dataset (and additional pre-processing of the data), Logistic Regression may perform better than Naive Bayes. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3.7:** As the value of C increases, we observe the sum-of-square values also increasing. This is expected, as C is the inverse of the regularization parameter, and the sum-of-square weights are inversely correlated with the regularization parameter. In other words, as the value of C gets larger, there is less regulation (i.e. the training data is trusted more) while lower values of C tell the algorithm/model not to \"listen\" to very large parameters it may see (i.e. the training data may not be representative of the actual data it will see). \n",

        "**ANSWER:** For the top 5 features (by weight) that have the highest impact towards classifying a document to a label, we are surprised to see bigrams that do not correspond to the actual label. As an example, \"are you\" (for atheism), \"is there\" (for graphics), \"it was\" (for space), and \"but he\" (for religion), have no relationship to their respective labels, yet they are features directly responsible (have the highest weights) for classifying documents to their respective labels. Additionally, the bigram \"cheers kent\" is seen in both alt.atheism and talk.religion.misc, which suggests some overlap. Though surprising, the results are expected, as the weights represent the frequency of bigrams/features across the entire training dataset, and does not contain any preprocessing, such as removal of common/stop words or other pruning to remove noise. In summary, while some of the top bigrams/features are surprising, the insights help us understand why certain misclassifications will occur on future document predictions. "

        "**ANSWER:** Without pre-processing the data, we achieved an f1 score of [0.7084739776490449] on a vocabulary size of [26879]. By pre-processing the data, our best f1 score increased by [0.01410303319071593] with a vocabulary reduction of only [3] words. The pre-processing included converting all strings to lowercase, splitting strings to a list, followed by removing stop words obtained from an nltk library. We experimented with other pre-processing, which included removal of apostrophe, converting all digits to 0, and applying stemming to consolidate like words (i.e. applying -> apply). Although we did not achieve an f1 score improvement of 0.02, we were also surprised that our vocabulary reduction (3 words) resulted in the greatest improvement over the other techniques we experimented with.

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
        "\n",
        "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
        "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
        "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
        "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
        "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
        "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",

        "* No need to apply pre-processing from question 5.\n",
        "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
        "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",

        "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
        "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",

        "**ANSWER:** In general, we observe an increasing f1 score as the size of the training data increases. However, when the vocabulary size becomes too large (and scattered), the f1 score begins to decrease. The observation is expected, as a reasonable amount of training data (i.e. words) is required for a model to become more generalized / handle a variety of words in a document. The decreasing f1 score (as vocabulary size increases) is counterintuitive, but is also expected. One potential explanation is increasing vocabularies increases chance of word overlap (i.e. in Q4, 'cheers kent' was weighted similarly for two different labels). Another potential explanation is word sparsity - as we saw in Q5, we can pre-process the text by removing stop words, applying stemming or similar, which aims to reduce vocabulary by removing noisy data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Results: The logistic regression model with l2 penalty (no reduction) and c value of [0.05] and a vocabulary size of [26,879] produced an f1 score of [0.6494001908701528]. At the same regularization strength, we see a logistic regression model with l1 penalty, we see a better f1 score of [0.6711544832986958] using a reduced vocabulary of only 740 words. "

One such explanation is the training data contained the word 'Mormon' uniquely across documents labeld 'comp.graphics', however, the same word more unique/prevenlant across documents labeled 'talk.religion.misc' - thus leading to the misclassification. This can potentially be solved through mechanisms that lower weight to religious words (i.e. Mormon) or using n-grams in order to give the model more 'context'. \n",
