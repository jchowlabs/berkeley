    "# Lab 1 -- RSA basics and getting started\n",

    "There will be quite a few things we will need to talk about, so get prepared and get excited!\n",
    "\n",
    "This, and subsequent labs, will try to work from simpler concepts to more complex.  One problem we find with working with RSA is you need to have a strong understanding of multiple concepts, some of the concepts will be foreign to you unless you were a double Math / CompSci major.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is good news / bad news, you may not be familiar with all the concepts, but you should be familiar with some.  If you feel unfamiliar with none, then with a small amount of catch up you should be right on par.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will cover some ancillary ideas which will lead to everything coming together in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note, this lab is intended to cover the implementation of RSA, so you can see it work in practice.  Our hope is that we will start with small easy to handle numbers, and you can see that the concepts aren't inherently difficult.  We will add increasingly larger numbers and increasingly professional implementations, and you should see that nothing really changed except for the sizes of numbers.  But since we are using a computer the size of the number is immaterial to us.  \n",
